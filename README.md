# SilverStripe Page Todo module #

## Introduction ##

Adds a simple "ToDo" text box to every page, editable through the CMS interface.
These todo entries can be tracked across pages by a new report showing all pages
with pending todos. This is a very simple module, it is not designed for sophisticated
task tracking, multiple authors etc - in fact, it doesn't even have checkboxes:
To finish a todo entry, simply remove the line of text from the textbox.

## Requirements ##

 * SilverStripe 3.1 or newer

## Maintainers ##

 * Ingo Schommer (ingo at silverstripe dot com)
