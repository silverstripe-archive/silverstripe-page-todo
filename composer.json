		These todo entries can be tracked across pages by a new report showing all pages
		with pending todos. This is a very simple module, it is not designed for sophisticated
		task tracking, multiple authors etc - in fact, it doesn't even have checkboxes:
		To finish a todo entry, simply remove the line of text from the textbox.",
